Description: efficient cache for gigabytes of data written in Go (library)
 Fast, concurrent, evicting in-memory cache written to keep big number of
 entries without impact on performance. BigCache keeps entries on heap
 but omits GC for them. To achieve that, operations on byte slices take
 place, therefore entries (de)serialization in front of the cache will
 be needed in most use cases.
